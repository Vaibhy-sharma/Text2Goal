# Background

## Goals
Goals are state of the organization and entities around it which the organization desire would become true. For instance, goverment may desire to achive hundred percentage literacy in its population or a corporation may wish to be the biggest player in its service market.

## Services
Organisations make many decisions every day from major ones such as founding a project to relatively minor such as ... More or less, every such decision has some effect on the its state and of entities of intrest (such as domestic population for a goverment). From these myriad of decisions an organisation or its agents (such as employees) makes, it is very difficult to manually track if they align with their goals or are in conflict of them. To make organization more goal-directed to reduce wastage and counter-productive decisions we need to assess each decision instantly and automatically. Assessing every decision manually is not feasiable as it would bog down organisation's operations and would be very costly. 

But goals of an entity chnages over time. And, prior decisions which have led to cuyrrent state of services may not be aligned with currents goals. So, it is not sufficient to assess decisions at the point of making only but we also need to assess our current state, services on a continous manner to make sure they are aligned with our present goals. This way, we can remove service which are not supporting our goals or worse are counterating in realisation our goals.
